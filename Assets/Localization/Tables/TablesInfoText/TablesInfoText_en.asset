      through crossing process.\r\n   To crossbreed, you need to place fully grown,
      weed-free flowers in the side sections of the table. Flowers should grow in
      the same room where the table is located.\r\n If flowers can be crossed, the
      side indicators of the table will light up green, otherwise the colour of the
      indicators will be red. You can only cross different flowers of the same level.\r\n  
      Also, if flowers can be crossed, the center indicator of the table will light
      up with the colour of the room where the bred flower needs to be grown, otherwise
      the colour of the center indicator will be red. The pot and soil for the hatched
      seed must be brought from the room indicated by the central indicator.\r\n  
      Once flowers have been placed in the side sections and the indicators have
      stopped glowing red, click on the center section of the table to start the
      crossing process. It will take some time. The higher the table level is, the
      less time this process takes. To start the crossing process, Carrie should
      not have any objects in her hands.\r\n   Once the crossing process is complete,
      flowers on the side sections will lose 1 stage of growth and the side indicators
      will turn red, while the center indicator will still be the room colour of
      the hatched seed. To plant a seed, you need to place a pot of soil in the center
      section of the table.\r\n   The result of crossing any two colours, with a
      small chance, can become one of the Rare colours. Rare flowers emit additional
      effects when planted, watered or fertilized.\r\n   To breed a level 3 flower,
      the crossing table must be improved to level 2 or higher. To breed a level
      4 flower, the crossing table must be improved to the maximum level 3."
